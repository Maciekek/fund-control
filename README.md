# Fund Control 

Small app to play a little bit with Remix.run (https://remix.run/).

# Quickstart

## Development


- Install all dependencies

  ```sh 
  npm install
  ```

- This step only applies if you've opted out of having the CLI install dependencies for you:
   
  ```sh
  npx remix init
  ```

- Init db
  ```sh
    npx prisma db seed
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get started:

- Email: `rachel@remix.run`
- Password: `racheliscool`
